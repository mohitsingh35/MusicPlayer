# Music Player ðŸŽ¶ | Android Foreground Service

Music Player is an Android application to stream music from a device, it is a very fine usage of foreground service where we need apps up all the time. This app is made by keeping clean architecture as 
first and foremost priority, I have used MVVM architecture, which separates business logic from ui due to which I am effectively able to handle the music state and effortlessly communicate
between different fragments.
